    "### How to Sample\n",
    "Statistical sampling is the process of selecting subsets of examples from a population with the objective of estimating properties of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is an active process. There is a goal of estimating population properties and control over how the sampling is to occur. This control falls short of influencing the process that generates each observation, such as performing an experiment. As such, sampling as a field sits neatly between uncontrolled observation and controlled experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Sampling is usually distinguished from the closely related field of experimental design, in that in experiments one deliberately perturbs some part of the population in order to see what the effect of that action is. […] Sampling is also usually distinguished from observational studies, in which one has little or no control over how the observations on the population were obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "— Pages 1-2, [Sampling](https://www.amazon.in/Sampling-Steven-K-Thompson-ebook/dp/B0078XBZ6K/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?dchild=1&keywords=Sampling+3rd+Edition+by+Steven+K.+Thompson&qid=1597809716&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmr0), Third Edition, 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many benefits to sampling compared to working with population or complete datasets, including reduced cost and greater speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform sampling, it requires that you carefully define your population and the method by which you will select (and possibly reject) observations to be a part of your data sample. This may very well be defined by the population parameters that you wish to estimate using the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some aspects to consider prior to collecting a data sample include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Goal:**  The population property that you wish to estimate using the sample.\n",
    "- **Population:**  The scope or domain from which observations could theoretically be made.\n",
    "- **Selection Criteria:**  The methodology that will be used to accept or reject observations in your sample.\n",

    "Sampling is required to make a statistical inference about the population from a small set of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize properties from the sample to the population. This process of estimation and generalization is much faster than working with all possible observations, but will contain errors. In many cases, we can quantify the uncertainty of our estimates and add error bars, such as confidence intervals.\n",

    "\n",
    "Other types of errors may be present, such as systematic errors in the way observations or measurements are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases and more, the statistical properties of the sample may be different from what would be expected in the idealized population, which in turn may impact the properties of the population that are being estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple methods, such as reviewing raw observations, summary statistics, and visualizations can help expose simple errors, such as measurement corruption and the over- or under- representation of a class of observations.\n",

    "Once we have a data sample, it can be used to estimate the population parameter.\n",

    "The problem is that we only have a single point estimate of the population parameter, with little idea of the variability or uncertainty in the estimate.\n",

The result can be both a more accurate estimate of the parameter (such as taking the mean of the estimates) and a quantification of the uncertainty of the estimate (such as adding a confidence interval or confidence level).\n",

The problem with this is that there will be some relationship between the samples as observations that will be shared across multiple subsamples. This means that the subsamples and the estimated population parameters are not strictly identical and independently distributed (strictly not iids). This has implications for statistical tests performed on the sample of estimated population parameters downstream, i.e. paired statistical tests may be required.\n",

    "- **k-fold Cross-Validation.** A dataset is partitioned into k groups, where each group is given the opportunity of being used as a held out test set leaving the remaining groups as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-fold cross-validation method specifically lends itself to use in the evaluation of predictive models that are repeatedly trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on a second held-out subset of the data.\n",

This process is repeated multiple times and the results are aggregated and summarized. The differences in techniques usually center around the method in which subsamples are chosen.\n",
