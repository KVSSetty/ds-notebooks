    "## Hypothesis Test for Comparing Algorithms\n",
    "Model selection involves evaluating a suite of different machine learning algorithms or modeling pipelines and comparing them based on their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model or modeling pipeline that achieves the best performance according to our performance metric is then selected as your final model that you can then use to start making predictions on unseen data/new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies to regression and classification predictive modeling tasks with classical machine learning algorithms as well as  deep learning algorithms. It's always the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, how do you know the difference between two models is real and not just a statistical chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be addressed using a statistical hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to evaluate each model on the same [k-fold cross-validation](https://medium.com/@kvssetty/introduction-to-k-fold-cross-validation-2a93c783ef08) split of the data (e.g. using the same random number seed to split the data in each case) and calculate a score for each split. This would give a sample of 10 scores for 10-fold cross-validation. The scores can then be compared using a paired statistical hypothesis test because the same treatment (rows of data) was used for each algorithm to come up with each score. The Paired Student’s t-Test could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with using the Paired Student’s t-Test, in this case, is that each evaluation of the model is not independent. This is because the same rows of data are used to train the data multiple times(specifically, **k-1** times) — actually, each time, except for the time a row of data is used in the hold-out test fold. This lack of independence in the evaluation means that the Paired Student’s t-Test is optimistically biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statistical test can be adjusted to take the lack of independence into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the number of folds and repeats of the procedure can be configured to achieve a good sampling of model performance that generalizes well to a wide range of problems and algorithms. Specifically two-fold cross-validation with five repeats, so-called 5×2-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach was proposed by Thomas [Dietterich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_G._Dietterich) in his 1998 paper titled [Approximate Statistical Tests for Comparing Supervised Classification Learning Algorithms.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790639)\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on this topic, we will have a separate tutorial shortly the title:\n",
    "[Statistical Significance Tests for Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms]().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we don’t need to implement this procedure ourselves."
